# rust-hello-world
Getting started with Rust development.

## Windows
Need to install [Microsoft C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)

Reccomended to select **.NET desktop development**, **Desktop development with C++**, and **Universal Windows Platform development**.

Then install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). It should recognize you're on Windows and point you to the Windows installers.

*Note: You can also install Rust for Linux under WSL, but for this I'm going to be looking into native Windows development to see how easy it is to develop cross-platform.*
